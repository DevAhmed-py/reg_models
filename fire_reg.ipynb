The aim is to reco- gnize the affected area and consequently the intensity of the imminent wild fire as early as possible in order to be able to adequatly assess the danger caused by the fire. To this aim, data from 517 wild fires have been collected. Develop a model that predicts the burnt forest area as accurately as possible from the given data."
